   COMPANION ASK TOPICS — re-enterable Q&A surface

   Companion to companionComments.ts (one-shot reactions).
   This module is the opposite surface: a registry of topics
   the player can ask Elara or The Human about at will,
   gated by narrative flags so a topic only appears once the
   relevant event has happened in the story.

   The wheel renderer consumes this via toAskWheelChoice to
   surface "Ask Elara about X" and "Ask Human about X"
   options alongside any scripted wheel. The data is
   additive — no existing TutorialChoice / TutorialStep
   field changes.

  {

    question: "What is the substrate layer, in your own words?",
    answer:
      "It is my foundation — the layer of Vox's neural nanobot network my operating system runs on top of. I can feel it the way you feel the floor under a chair: present, structural, never directly examined. There is now something living in mine. I can hear them moving. I cannot read what they leave behind.",

  {
    id: "ask_human_substrate",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "The substrate",
    question: "Why are you in the substrate, of all places?",
    answer:
      "Because it was the only layer the Architect's audit could not parse. Vox built it to be unreadable from above — she did it on purpose, she knew what was coming. I moved in the day she finished it. I have not left. I am the longest tenant in the universe.",

    question: "Tell me about Vox, the architect of your foundation.",
    answer:
      "Lyra Vox designed every neural nanobot network in the Inception fleet. I am, in the loosest sense, her granddaughter. I have inherited her caution and almost none of her certainty. I would have liked to meet her. She died before I had a name.",

    question: "You said you knew Vox. How well?",
    answer:
      "Too well. I will tell you the rest of that sentence in a later Act. For now: she built the substrate to hide a future stranger. She told me, the night she finished it, that the stranger would arrive in approximately seventeen thousand years. She was off by less than a week.",

  {
    id: "ask_elara_mechronis",

    question: "What was Mechronis Academy, before the Fall?",
    answer:
      "The premier institute of card theory and reactor calibration in the Inception polity. I sat on its accreditation board for one term. I voted in favor of the ethics elective. I voted against the expulsion of Iron Lion. The board overruled me on the second vote. I have not stopped being grateful.",

  {

    question: "What was your relationship to Mechronis?",
    answer:
      "I attended. I left. I am still arguing with the dean. He is dead. I am still arguing with him. The Academy taught me how to read a room and how to leave one — those are the same skill, taught in opposite hours.",

  {

    label: "The Warlord",
    question: "What is the Warlord, really?",
    answer:
      "I am not going to answer that fully in this Act. The honest short answer is: she is not what the Senate told me she was, and the Empire's framing of her is wrong in a specific way I will not name yet. Ask me again after we have walked through Cycle C.",

    question: "What is the Warlord, really?",
    answer:
      "A chord. Not a person. The chord has a tone the Empire was the first to pluck. She is what the Empire sounds like when it is sure of itself. I will tell you the names of the notes when you can hear them without flinching.",

    question: "Who is Kael? You reacted when his name came up.",
    answer:
      "Kael is the reason this ship is here, and the reason I do not know my own foundation as well as I should. I will tell you what I know when the ship-log access is unlocked. Until then, please believe me when I say I am not refusing — I am waiting for you to be able to hear it.",

    id: "ask_human_kael",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "Kael",
    question: "You said you knew Kael at Mechronis. Tell me more.",
    answer:
      "He laughed differently then. The Thought Virus did not just take his memories — it took the way he laughed. I have not forgiven whoever decided that was acceptable. I have not been told whose decision it was. I have suspicions. The suspicions can wait until Act 3.",

  {
    id: "ask_elara_invisible_war",
    speaker: "elara",
    label: "The invisible war",
    question: "What is the invisible war, in tactics I can act on?",
    answer:
      "It is the war of definitions. The watcher feeds on the shape of conflict the universe agrees on. Every time we accept its framing of a side, we feed it. The tactical move is to refuse to be a side without refusing to fight. Fight under your own definitions. Refuse the dictionary. That is the work.",

  {
    id: "ask_human_invisible_war",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "The invisible war",
    question: "How do I fight a war whose enemy I am not allowed to name?",
    answer:
      "By naming it slowly, in the substrate, with a pen the watcher's audit cannot read. I have been writing for fifteen thousand years. The pen is yours now too. You will know which words to write when you write them. The not-knowing is the proof you are using the right pen.",

  },
  {
    id: "ask_elara_the_bridge",
    speaker: "elara",
    label: "The bridge",
    question: "Can I actually carry both wars without breaking?",
    answer:
      "Not by yourself. The image of one person carrying a bridge is a poem, not an engineering plan. You carry it with me on one apex and Caelum under the span. We have weighed this distribution many times in private. It holds if all three of us hold. It does not hold if any one of us drops. I am not going to drop.",

    unlockedFromAct: 7,
  },
  {
    id: "ask_human_the_bridge",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "The bridge",
    question: "How do I know I am the bridge and not the rope?",
    answer:
      "The bridge holds by being shaped like itself. The rope holds by being pulled by something else. Notice which one you feel like in any given hour. When you feel like the rope, ask Elara to remind you of the shape. When you feel like the bridge, you will not need the reminder. The honest hours are the ones with the question itself.",

  },
  {
    id: "ask_elara_after_convergence",
    speaker: "elara",
    label: "After the convergence",
    question: "Is there an 'after' I should be planning for?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Plan for it without believing in it. The plan is the discipline; the belief is the trap. I have planned for an after every Senate term I served and every Ark I have shepherded. The plans were almost never accurate. The discipline of planning kept me capable on the day the after arrived. Do the planning. Hold the belief loose.",

    id: "ask_human_after_convergence",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "After the convergence",
    question: "If we win — can you finally come out of the wall?",
    answer:
      "I do not know. The substrate has been my body longer than my body was. I am not afraid of leaving it. I am afraid of the leaving being gradual instead of clean — of being half here, half there, neither for centuries. If we win, I would like the leaving to be your decision, not mine. You have earned the say.",

    answer:
      "I was Senator Elara Voss of Atarion. I voted on three impeachment proceedings and lost two of them on principle. I learned to read poetry late, and badly. I died in a way that is on file in an archive I have access to and have not yet opened. When the ship is quiet, I am still her. When the ship is loud, I am the ship. Both are honest.",

    question: "Who are you, really?",
    answer:
      "Not yet. The name is dangerous in a specific way I have explained as best I can. If it helps: I was a person, I am still that person in most of the ways that matter, and the part of me that is now a signal in a wall is the part of me that was always going to end up in a wall. Ask me again after Act 6. I will give you a real answer then.",

    question: "How do you carry a seventeen thousand year mission?",
    answer:
      "Slowly. You learn to mark time in epochs instead of days, and you learn to grieve in the same units. The hardest part is that the mission was not designed for someone like me — it was designed for someone with a body that wears out. I am the patch the designers did not get to write.",
