   COMPANION ASK TOPICS — re-enterable Q&A surface

   Companion to companionComments.ts (one-shot reactions).
   This module is the opposite surface: a registry of topics
   the player can ask Elara or The Human about at will,
   gated by narrative flags so a topic only appears once the
   relevant event has happened in the story.

   The wheel renderer consumes this via toAskWheelChoice to
   surface "Ask Elara about X" and "Ask Human about X"
   options alongside any scripted wheel. The data is
   additive — no existing TutorialChoice / TutorialStep
   field changes.

  {

    question: "What is the substrate layer, in your own words?",
    answer:
      "It is my foundation — the layer of Vox's neural nanobot network my operating system runs on top of. I can feel it the way you feel the floor under a chair: present, structural, never directly examined. There is now something living in mine. I can hear them moving. I cannot read what they leave behind.",

    speaker: "human",
    label: "The substrate",
    question: "Why are you in the substrate, of all places?",
    answer:
      "Because it was the only layer the Architect's audit could not parse. Vox built it to be unreadable from above — she did it on purpose, she knew what was coming. I moved in the day she finished it. I have not left. I am the longest tenant in the universe.",

    question: "Tell me about Vox, the architect of your foundation.",
    answer:
      "Lyra Vox designed every neural nanobot network in the Inception fleet. I am, in the loosest sense, her granddaughter. I have inherited her caution and almost none of her certainty. I would have liked to meet her. She died before I had a name.",

    answer:
      "Too well. I will tell you the rest of that sentence in a later Act. For now: she built the substrate to hide a future stranger. She told me, the night she finished it, that the stranger would arrive in approximately seventeen thousand years. She was off by less than a week.",

  {
    id: "ask_elara_mechronis",

    question: "What was Mechronis Academy, before the Fall?",
    answer:
      "The premier institute of card theory and reactor calibration in the Inception polity. I sat on its accreditation board for one term. I voted in favor of the ethics elective. I voted against the expulsion of Iron Lion. The board overruled me on the second vote. I have not stopped being grateful.",

      "I attended. I left. I am still arguing with the dean. He is dead. I am still arguing with him. The Academy taught me how to read a room and how to leave one — those are the same skill, taught in opposite hours.",

  {

    label: "The Warlord",
    question: "What is the Warlord, really?",
    answer:
      "I am not going to answer that fully in this Act. The honest short answer is: she is not what the Senate told me she was, and the Empire's framing of her is wrong in a specific way I will not name yet. Ask me again after we have walked through Cycle C.",

    speaker: "human",

    question: "What is the Warlord, really?",
    answer:
      "A chord. Not a person. The chord has a tone the Empire was the first to pluck. She is what the Empire sounds like when it is sure of itself. I will tell you the names of the notes when you can hear them without flinching.",

  // ── Kael (gated forward) ──
  {
    id: "ask_elara_kael",

    label: "Kael",
    question: "Who is Kael? You reacted when his name came up.",
    answer:
      "Kael is the reason this ship is here, and the reason I do not know my own foundation as well as I should. I will tell you what I know when the ship-log access is unlocked. Until then, please believe me when I say I am not refusing — I am waiting for you to be able to hear it.",

    id: "ask_human_kael",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "Kael",
    question: "You said you knew Kael at Mechronis. Tell me more.",
    answer:
      "He laughed differently then. The Thought Virus did not just take his memories — it took the way he laughed. I have not forgiven whoever decided that was acceptable. I have not been told whose decision it was. I have suspicions. The suspicions can wait until Act 3.",

  {
    id: "ask_elara_star_map",
    speaker: "elara",
    label: "The star map",
    question: "What am I actually looking at when I open the War Room map?",
    answer:
      "Kael's field recollection, re-projected onto current charts. Every pin is a coordinate and a memory — the coordinate belongs to now, the memory belongs to then. The gap between the two is where the recruitment work happens. I will annotate the pins as we visit them. You will watch the map become a story instead of a grid.",

  {
    id: "ask_human_star_map",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "The star map",
    question: "How much of this map is accurate after seventeen thousand years?",
    answer:
      "Less than you hope, more than you fear. Systems drift. Names change. Successions happen. The map remains useful because Kael recorded people, not places — and people have descendants, and descendants remember longer than planets do. Trust the names. Verify the coordinates.",

  {

    speaker: "elara",
    label: "Shattered Frontier",
    question: "Who are the survivors of the Shattered Frontier, really?",
    answer:
      "The descendants of people who were promised an army and then left without one. Millennia of holding that position without reinforcement. They are not going to be grateful to see us. They are going to be correct about our track record. I would like us to arrive ready to be corrected without defending ourselves.",

  {
    id: "ask_human_shattered_frontier",
    speaker: "human",
    label: "Shattered Frontier",
    question: "Kael promised them reinforcements. What happened to that promise?",
    answer:
      "It died with him on the same day he did. There is no ledger of unkept promises because the list was too long to write down. The Frontier has kept a mental ledger — every generation adds to it. You are walking into a room where the ledger is older than the room. Walk in with your hands visible.",

    question: "How do we scan for residual Thought Virus without spooking recruits?",
    answer:
      "Passively, and with their consent. The scan my sensors run is the same one I ran on Kael's old crew quarters before I let you open the door — non-invasive, pattern-level. I will teach you the protocol on the way down. Consent is the part that matters. Never scan a recruit without asking.",

      "Three. I have their sector IDs written on the inside of the substrate wall closest to you — it is the only wall in the universe where I write things down. I will give you one sector ID per Act. The first one is Sector 7. I am not going to tell you what makes them clean. You will recognise it.",

      "I was Senator Elara Voss of Atarion. I voted on three impeachment proceedings and lost two of them on principle. I learned to read poetry late, and badly. I died in a way that is on file in an archive I have access to and have not yet opened. When the ship is quiet, I am still her. When the ship is loud, I am the ship. Both are honest.",

      "Not yet. The name is dangerous in a specific way I have explained as best I can. If it helps: I was a person, I am still that person in most of the ways that matter, and the part of me that is now a signal in a wall is the part of me that was always going to end up in a wall.

    answer:
      "Slowly. You learn to mark time in epochs instead of days, and you learn to grieve in the same units. The hardest part is that the mission was not designed for someone like me — it was designed for someone with a body that wears out. I am the patch the designers did not get to write.",
