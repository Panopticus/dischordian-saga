   COMPANION ASK TOPICS — re-enterable Q&A surface

   Companion to companionComments.ts (one-shot reactions).
   This module is the opposite surface: a registry of topics
   the player can ask Elara or The Human about at will,
   gated by narrative flags so a topic only appears once the
   relevant event has happened in the story.

   The wheel renderer consumes this via toAskWheelChoice to
   surface "Ask Elara about X" and "Ask Human about X"
   options alongside any scripted wheel. The data is
   additive — no existing TutorialChoice / TutorialStep
   field changes.

      "It is my foundation — the layer of Vox's neural nanobot network my operating system runs on top of. I can feel it the way you feel the floor under a chair: present, structural, never directly examined. There is now something living in mine. I can hear them moving. I cannot read what they leave behind.",

    question: "Why are you in the substrate, of all places?",
    answer:
      "Because it was the only layer the Architect's audit could not parse. Vox built it to be unreadable from above — she did it on purpose, she knew what was coming. I moved in the day she finished it. I have not left. I am the longest tenant in the universe.",

I died in a way that is on file in an archive I have access to and have not yet opened. When the ship is quiet, I am still her. When the ship is loud, I am the ship. Both are honest.",

Before that I was a boy who read too many case files and decided, very early, that the world needed someone to keep reading them. I gave up the name when I took the role. The role is the villain. You have heard me say this. What I have not said is that I miss the name. I miss it like a limb. When you speak it next — and I am going to tell it to you, later, when Elara cannot hear — I will not flinch. I will only thank you for saying it out loud once before the silence closes over it again.",
